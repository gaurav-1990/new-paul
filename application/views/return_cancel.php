(Please note that this facility is only available on stitched products such as Kurtis, Dresses, Pants, Tops, etc.)  You can either raise request to exchange or return the product in this particular scenario.</li>
       <li>Orders with proper original packaging, tags intact and unused products will only be entertained for a return or exchange. This will help us ensure a safe transit.</li>
    
       </ul>

<ul>
<li>•	Return or exchange can be requested within 24 hours from the time of  receiving the order. </li>

<li>•	You can schedule a reverse pickup under My Orders section.</li>
<li>•	Orders will be picked only from the delivery address.  If you are not available during the attempt(s) of reverse pick up , the product will be deemed accepted wishfully. No queries will be entertained for the same order thereafter.</li>
<li>•	Once the product reaches our warehouse, it takes usually 2-3 business days for initiation of refund or issuance of fresh article, after complete quality check is done.
